# Beyond Quantum
A real-time strategy about quantum physics and beyond

## Game instructions
### Goal

Beyond Quantum University trains scientists such as . Preserve your own Beyond Quantum University and bring down others'!

Achieve this by engaging your scientists to debates with other scientists and universities!

### Control

- Select unit/building: Left click mouse. 
- Move unit/attack: Right click mouse.
- Zoom in/out: Use keys Z/X or mouse wheel
- Scroll camera: Move mouse to border, or use keys W/S/A/S (alternatively use keys up/down/left/right).
- Rotate camera: Use keys G/H for left/right rotation. Hold mouse right click for arbitrary directions.

### Population

One player can hold at most 20 scientists at the same time. The top left panel shows the current population/maximum population.

### Talents

The top left panel also shows the player's current number of talents. Talents are needed to train experts of quantum physics and beyond (Wigner, de Broglie, Einstein, and Bohr). 
To gather talents, send Wigner with his friend pupil to the school and back. Each trip increases the talent number by 1.

### Scientists

Trained by spending talents.
- Wigner. Gathers talents.
- De Broglie. Attacks nonlocally..
- Bohr. Tunnels through obstacles.
- Einstein. Attacks with tremendous powern.

### Advanced operations:

Combat units can be moved inside the university for defence. Use the university bottom panel to summon nearby units, or to eject summoned units.


## Quotes behind the audio voice effects

### Quotes from Niels Bohr:

"Prediction is very difficult, especially about the future."

"Those who are not shocked when they first come across quantum mechanics cannot possibly have understood it."

"Everything we call real is made of things that cannot be regarded as real."

"A great truth is a truth whose opposite is also a great truth."

"There are some things so serious that you have to laugh at them."

"Never express yourself more clearly than you are able to think."

### Quotes from Albert Einstein:

"Life is like riding a bicycle. To keep your balance, you must keep moving."

"God does not play dice."

"The only source of knowledge is experience."

"Reality is merely an illusion, albeit a very persistent one."

"Once we accept our limits, we go beyond them."

"Try not to become a man of success, but rather try to become a man of value."

### Quotes from Eugene Wigner:

"The laws of quantum mechanics itself cannot be formulated ... without recourse to the concept of consciousness."

"The optimist regards the future as uncertain."

"The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics"

### Quotes from Louis de Broglie:

"The electron can no longer be conceived as a single, small granule of electricity; it must be associated with a wave, and this wave is no myth; its wavelength can be measured and its interferences predicted."

“Science itself, no matter whether it is the search for truth or merely the need to gain control over the external world, to alleviate suffering, or to prolong life, is ultimately a matter of feeling, or rather, of desire-the desire to know or the desire to realize.”

"The actual state of our knowledge is always provisional and... there must be, beyond what is actually known, immense new regions to discover."
